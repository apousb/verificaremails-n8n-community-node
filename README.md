Once registered, you can activate the services you need:  
- Email verification  
- Phone verification  
- Postal address verification  
- Name, surname, and gender detection  

When creating your account, select your preferred language. All API messages will use this language setting.

[![Dashboard Verificaremails](https://www.verificaremails.com/docs/assets/Dashboard_paso_1.png)](https://dashboard.verificaremails.com/app/public/register)

After activating your account, choose the service you want to use. You can navigate between services using the top-left logo or the banners.

[![Dashboard Verificaremails](https://www.verificaremails.com/docs/assets/Dashboard_paso_2.png)](https://dashboard.verificaremails.com/)

Next, go to the API section of the chosen service.

[![Dashboard Verificaremails](https://www.verificaremails.com/docs/assets/Dashboard_paso_3.png)](https://dashboard.verificaremails.com/)

Click on the **"+ Create new API"** button (top right). Give the API a name and optionally set a credit limit.

## Using the Node in n8n

In n8n, search for **VerificarEmails** in the Community Nodes section and add it to your workflow.

[![Dashboard Verificaremails](https://www.verificaremails.com/docs/assets/n8n_paso_1.png)](https://dashboard.verificaremails.com/)

If you plan to use multiple validation services, it‚Äôs recommended to use the same API key for all of them.  
To do this, open the **gear icon** in the credentials, select the active token, and reuse it across services.

[![Dashboard Verificaremails](https://www.verificaremails.com/docs/assets/n8n_paso_2.png)](https://dashboard.verificaremails.com/)

When configuring the node, select the specific service you want to use (Email, Phone, Name/Surname, Postal address, etc.).

[![Dashboard Verificaremails](https://www.verificaremails.com/docs/assets/n8n_paso_3.png)](https://dashboard.verificaremails.com/)

Each service not only validates the data but also provides additional details. Check the **Result Guide** section in our documentation to better understand and use the results.

[![Dashboard Verificaremails](https://www.verificaremails.com/docs/assets/n8n_paso_4.png)](https://dashboard.verificaremails.com/)

Error messages will always be returned in the account‚Äôs selected language.
